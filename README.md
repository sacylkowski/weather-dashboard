This app uses a handful of Openweather App APIs to gather information for current weather and a 5 day forecast.  When you search a city name, you get the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV Index, and an icon of the weather.  The current UV Index shows if it's favorable, moderate, or severe conditions.
